Some repositories place limits on the size of data that can be deposited. These limits may involve: 



1. absolute limits, i.e., they will accept no dataset above a certain size;

2. relative limits, e.g., data above a certain size is subject to approval or perhaps additional costs;

3. submission limits, e.g., data above a certain size requires special arrangements for submission.



### Terms

* *contact*: Contact the repository management for depositing large datasets.
