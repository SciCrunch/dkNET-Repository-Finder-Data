Some repositories place limits on the size of data that can be deposited. These limits may involve: 



1. absolute limits, i.e., they will accept no dataset above a certain size;

2. relative limits, e.g., data above a certain size is subject to approval or perhaps additional costs;

3. submission limits, e.g., data above a certain size requires special arrangements for submission.



### Terms

* *contact*: Contact the repository management for depositing large datasets.

Check whether there's a version number in the metadata, check policy for information, if they handle it as a new data submission then the answer is 'no' unless there's something clearly about the relationship between the different versions. ]]></text><answer>yes</answer></question><question id="[decision-graph.dg]qPhi"><text><![CDATA[# Can the repository store data containing PHI or any other sensitive information?



The repository needs to have an explicit statement that they're able to handle identified human subject data or other sensitive information that cannot be made public.  Generally, the repository will have documentation about access requirements, e.g., applying to a data access committee to receive permission to use the data.

The repository is primarily built around a single type of data, e.g. imaging data although it may allow multiple types of imaging data.

For example, the repository provides a formatted data citation with each dataset.

If using accession numbers, check in [Identifiers.org](http://identifiers.org/) whether the repository has their prefix [registered](https://registry.identifiers.org/registry).



### Terms

* *PID:* Persistent IDendifier - a string or a number that uniquely identifies a dataset indefinitely.

* *Supports but does not generate:* The data repository has a specific field for storing a PID.

How to tell:  Do the public datasets have a DOI? Sometimes a repository will generate a DOI on request so, may need to look into the documentation.



### Terms

* *DOI*: Digital Object Identifier. See [doi.org](https://doi.org).

Add any information on the granularity of the DOI in the Notes Field, e.g., assigns DOIs at the study level but not at the individual experiment level.]]></text><answer>yes</answer></question></transcript></interview>
